    "#### <span style=\"color:grey\">Week 2 Practice Project</span>\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Topics Covered:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors,Support Vector Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "Marketing\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting customer’s response to a particular productwith the help of a variety of classificationmodels like Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, SupportVector Machine on the marketing campaigndata.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "An E-com company has recently run a marketing campaignaround its customers. The company hascollected various attributes regarding its customerslike Education, Marital_Status, Country,& variousdata regarding the amount of money they spend on buyingproducts for the company's website. Now,For the launch of a new product, the companies wantto know whether the customers will respond tothat product or not.  As data scientists, we haveto predict if a customer will respond to a productornot.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset can be found <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/marketing-data'>here</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Feature Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *ID*: Customer's unique identifier\n",
    "- *Year_Birth*: Customer's birth year\n",
    "- *Education*: Customer's education level\n",
    "- *Marital_Status*: Customer's marital status\n",
    "- *Income*: Customer's yearly household income\n",
    "- *Kidhome*: Number of children in customer's household\n",
    "- *Teenhome*: Number of teenagers in customer's household\n",
    "- *Dt_Customer*: Date of customer's enrollment with the company\n",
    "- *Recency*: Number of days since customer's last purchase\n",
    "- *MntWines*: Amount spent on wine in the last 2 years\n",
    "- *MntFruits*: Amount spent on fruits in the last 2 years\n",
    "- *MntMeatProducts*: Amount spent on meat in the last 2 years\n",
    "- *MntFishProducts*: Amount spent on fish in the last 2 years\n",
    "- *Response*: Response to the product (Target)\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete feature details can be found in the abovementioned link.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Loading and Exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import necessary libraries.\n",
    "2. Display a sample of five rows of the data frame.\n",
    "3. Check the shape of the data (number of rows and column).Check the general information about the dataframe using .info() method.\n",
    "4. Check the percentage of missing values in each columnof the data frame. Drop themissing values if there are any.\n",
    "5. Check if there are any duplicate rows.\n",
    "6. Remove the extra spaces in the ‘Income’ column name.\n",
    "7. Check the dtype of values in column 'Income'.Convertthe values in the 'Income'column to numeric format.\n",
    "8. Check the basic statistics of the data-frame usingdescribe() method.\n",
    "9. Write a function which will take the data frame asinput and will plot a bar plot whichrepresents the percentage of distribution of eachlabel of ‘Country’ column.\n",
    "10. Plot a bar plot which represents all the qualificationsof the customers country-wise.What is the percentage of graduates in Spain?\n",
    "11. Plot a percentage segment graph between the ‘Marital_Status’,and ‘Education’ ofcustomers.\n",
    "12. Plot a percentage segment graph between the ‘‘Education”and ‘Country’ of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model Building and Evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plot a count-plot of the target variable.\n",
    "2. Drop 'ID', 'Year_Birth', 'Dt_Customer', 'Country','Education', 'Marital_Status' columns.\n",
    "3. Store the target column (i.e.Response) in the y variableand the rest of the columns in the X variable.\n",
    "4. Split the dataset into two parts (i.e. 70% train and30% test) using random_state=42.\n",
    "5. Train a Naive Bayes model and plot the below metrics.\n",
    "   - Plot the error plots for the naive bayes models onthe given alpha values (i.e.alpha=[0.00001,0.0001,0.001,0.1,1,10,100,1000]). Choosethe best alpha.\n",
    "   - Train the model on the best alpha value. Print theaccuracy score, classificationreport, roc_auc curve for both the train and testset.\n",
    "6. Train a K-Nearest Neighbors classification model andplot the below metrics.\n",
    "   - Plot the error plots for the  K-nearest neighborsmodels on the given K values(i.e.k_value=[3,5,7,9,11,13,15]). Find the best K .\n",
    "   - Train the model on the best K value. Print the accuracy score, classificationreport, roc_auc curve for both the train and test set.\n",
    "7. Train a Support Vector classification model and plot the below metrics.\n",
    "   - Plot the error plots for the support vector classificationmodel on the  given Cvalues(i.e. c_value=[0.01,0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000]).Find the best C.\n",
    "   - Train the model on the best C value. Print the accuracyscore, classificationreport, roc_auc curve for both the train and test set.\n"
